How To start/use:
---------------------------

To use this discord.py file you need to install all the packages such as discord within the python file and pip (wich should be automatocally installed on anything up to date) 

Discord.py download -----> https://pypi.org/project/discord.py/

You do not have to use this download as there is allways another way to install it as with the reposetory, i use pycharm so it is in the corner with the packages install area then just search 'discord'. Make sure to call the function.
